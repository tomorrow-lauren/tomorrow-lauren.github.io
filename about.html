    <h1>About the Sitemaster</h1>
    <p>Lauren Reid is a burgeoning web dev from Bloomington, Illinois. She loves the geeky, nerdy, and goofy things in life [which explains her fiance]. She has a bachelor's degree in Political Science from Knox College. These things make her the target audience for Hamilton: The Musical. Her biggest quirk is probably not liking to order the same food as other people at restaurants.</p>
    <p>She also has 3 years experience as a User Interface Designer, and a penchant for making third person bios.</p> </div>

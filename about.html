 <p class="about">Lauren Reid is a burgeoning web dev from Bloomington, Illinois. She loves the geeky, nerdy, and goofy things in life [which explains her fiance]. She has a bachelor's degree in Political Science from Knox College. These things make her the target audience for Hamilton: The Musical. Her biggest quirk is probably not liking to order the same food as other people at restaurants. </p>

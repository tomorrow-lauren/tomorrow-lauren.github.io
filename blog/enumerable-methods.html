<h2>Going Through the Module cycle</h2>
    <h3>What is Enumerable?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Enumerable is a module, which is a mixin class that you can plug in, without it needing to be of a certain parentage. These classes of methods are for searching and traversing things. Ruby is fairly unique as a programming language, because it allows for these mixin modules. Basically, say there is a child of family X. Now being a X child endows them with certain things, like a large bank account or trusting manservant. But if they wanted to fight crime, X child would have to get outside help, like from module Assassin or Vigilante. Then they could use all of the things in that module to fight crime or save their city.</p>
        <p>puts x_child.injustice?(list_of_events) <br>
          end
          <br>
          So, .injustice? is a public instance method of module Vigilante.
        <p> So now that we understand modules, mixins and Enumerable.
      </div>
    <h3>What does #cycle do?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Cycle is a public instance method of Enumerable. It's used to cycle through an array. If you pass it a number, that's the toal number of times it will cycle through an array. You can also pair it with other items, like to go backwards through an array 3 times, you could do [1,2,3].reverse_each.cycle(3) and you'd get [3,2,1,3,2,1,3,2,1].</p> </div>
    <h3>So in Summary</h3>
      <div>
        <p>You can us enumerable methods to iterate and sort and seperate and do all kinds of neat stuff, because Ruby likes to let all the mixins and modules and code get together. It really allows for a great customization.</p>

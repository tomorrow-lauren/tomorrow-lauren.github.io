  <h1>Making of a Website</h1>
<h2>Reflection on the Composition of a Website and the Overall Phase 0 Experience</h2>
    <h3>What I Like About You</h3>
      <div>
        <p>In terms of the website, I found that doing the colors, finding things out, those were the things I enjoyed. I've done design work and I like color matching. It rather surprised me how much I still enjoyed this bit though. I guess it rekindled my keeness for it. Figuring out the nitpicks was a bit fun. </p>
        <p>Overall, I loved the community sense. I wish there had rather been a coder's anonymous but honestly, this was one of the most supportive experiences I've probably had in my life. I genuinely look forward to going onsite.Everyone's here to help, support and rive one another.</p>
      </div>
    <h3>Challenge Accepted</h3>
      <div>
        <p>So many things were challenging with this site. Mostly positioning. Remembering everything. I think I need some more counseling with imposter syndrome.</p>
        <p>I think that the most challenging thing is over. It's being seperated. I think the sense of community is only going to grow.</p>
           </div>
    <h3>Developmental Delights and Final Thoughts</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Planning. I'm terrible at it and I think I would do so much better if I did it well. I think this is the most important thing I've STARTED to improve during Phase 0 and I only hope to get better. </p>
        <p>Overall, this was a wonderful first step. I think this gave me a brilliant foundation and left me feeling really good. I can't wait for Tuesday, to go on site and meet up with everyone. </p>

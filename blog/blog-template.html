How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was odd. I've done it many times on my own and never really felt as confident as when I explained things and worked on a project with someone else.
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yes. It really helps me think of what elements I need to gather together to get it right. It also helps me realize what I can or can't do within whatever framework I have.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We decided that something that you could write, something that seemed within your vision, adhered to your design ideas.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I learned some new HTML tricks, because I can't CSS yet and that's been dragging on me - I have like a jQuery/CSS complete vision and I think KNOWING what I can do is making building the small parts aggravating. It's a personal flaw that I need to work on.
This is my wireframe I made for JUST THE BLOG PART

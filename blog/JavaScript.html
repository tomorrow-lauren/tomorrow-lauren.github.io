  <h1>JavaScript vs Ruby</h1>
<h2>Function-ing Well vs Being Method-ical. </h2>
    <h3>What are these things, JAH-VAH-SCKRIPT and ROO-BEE? </h3>
      <div>
        <p>Ok, let's start by defining some terms. JavaScript and Ruby are programming languages. They're languages programmers use to talk to computers. They are both Object-oriented, so they provide the ability to make objects within the code and then code to do stuff with those objects. Objects can be numbers, arrays, or words (in coding, they're called "strings" and usually seen between "these handy quotes"). Many programming codes share similarities. JavaScript (herein referred to as JS for short) and Ruby both have similar loops, similar objects, use numbers. There are some differences, however. For example, functions vs methods.</p>
      </div>
    <h3>Is this where your punny subtitle comes in?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Oh how KIND of you to notice. Yes, here it is. So, let's start with functions. JS functions are bits of code that take an input (like "bubbles"), evaluate it and return a value(like "OOPS POPPED IT."). Got it? Now Ruby has these things called methods. They take input, evaluate it and return a value. Sounds familiar, right?</p>
           </div>
         <h3>...they're the same.</h3>
           <div>
             <p>No. See, they handle their operations differently. As Nick/Skilldrick <a href="http://skilldrick.co.uk/2010/09/why-javascript-is-awesome/">wrote</a> "A language like Ruby is a toolbox with some really neat little tools that do their job really nicely. JavaScript is a leather sheath with a really really sharp knife inside." I like this analogy, because it explains many of the chief differences between the two, including those that many of my classmates have covered. In terms of functioning, though, JS is again, very straightforward. You make the function, it does the thing. Done. You can pretty much declare internal objects outside the function. Methods are different in terms of changing, or adding anything. There's also a difference between Blocks, procs and lambda methods (for more on that check out <a href="http://www.reactive.io/tips/2008/12/21/understanding-ruby-blocks-procs-and-lambdas/">this article</a> or <a href="http://skilldrick.co.uk/2011/01/ruby-vs-javascript-functions-procs-blocks-and-lambdas/">this</a>). </p>
        </div>
        <h3>So, sum this up for me?</h3>
          <div><p>Basically, JS and Ruby are two languages, both alike in object orientation. From these civil codes rise new mutiny - differences in how they operate functions. JS uses functions to do all manner of things - one weapon, many uses. Ruby has many different tools for processing these things. They all serve their seperate purposes. Hopefully this illustrates the massive difference between functions and methods. Thanks!</p></div>

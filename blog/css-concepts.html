<h1>Keeping it Inline!</h1>
   <h2>Laying Out Inline and Block</h2>
            <h3>What is inline? What is Block?</h3>

                <p>Many elements have a natural block state or inline state. what does this mean? </p>
                <p>Inline means that the items are in a line. They do not have padding, they display everything in the same line. They're agile, but they don't really have a border. They're like a speedster in a video game. You can have loads of them, but sometimes they just aren't appropriate for the elements. Haveing all the paragraphs inline wouldn't look so good, right?</p>
                <p> Block is a different style. it BLOCKS everything from being near it - refuses any other element in the same line. This your tough guy - has a border, but doesn't want anything else on the same line. For example, p has an inherent block style, which is why these paragraphs are all on different lines.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>How about inline-block?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>This is the code combination of both inline and block, just as the name would imply. Basically, if you want objects next to each other, but still have the ability to push around other elements like a big old block, you need inline-block. It's the all around warrior - it can protect itself but it also has some speed.</p> <p>Here's an example: The blog sections above are sectioned using inline-block to allow for even-ness all around.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>What do we do with a command like inline-block?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>The key is to use all of these commands to the best effect. Much like in a raiding party or Mario Kart race, you have to take context into account. Inline is useful if the elements simply need to be next to each other. Block is good if you need borders but nothing else in the same area. Inline is the combo that makes both features available. </p>

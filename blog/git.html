      Everyone's been there. You and your friends find a magical pair of pants, on the last summer before college. That might be a book. Anyway, you all want these pants, to work them, show off how fantastic they make you look. What if the pants were a piece of code? Maybe a fashion app? You all love it, want to work, but unlike pants, you can all work on it at once! How does <i>this</i> magic work? Version control! It's this magical ability to have a central file, and everyone can control their own version.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>What are the benefits of version control?</b>
       <br>Well, say you're writing code for a pants design app. Becky can write the section on bedazzling and merge it with the larger files. At the same time, Paula can present her code regarding plotting pleats in pants. The real benefit is allowing everyone to create versions separately, on their own local machines, and merge them into one document.
    </p>

      <b>How does git help you keep track of changes?</b>
       <br>Now, git is your new coding best friend when it comes to version control. It keeps track of the changes you've made. If a file is changed, saved again, new folders made, it keeps track. Anytime you are in your repository [The place where you store your code], you can check your git status by typing just that. You know quickly what changes have been made. Then you just type git add and tell them which file you are ready to commit [which means to make it the master copy as it were], and commit them each.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Why use GitHub to store your code?</b>
       <br>GitHub is really well structured to work alongside your git. It also allows for cross-Internet collaboration. As well, GitHub enables others to view your code, offer suggestions and to allow you to see others work and use them to improve or assist your own.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>That's why we do this!</b>
        <br>Dev Bootcamp is an environment where everyone wants everyone to succeed. Using version control, git and GitHub to enchance our communication and our community is just one step in creating greatness!
